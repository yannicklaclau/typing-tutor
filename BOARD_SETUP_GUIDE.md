# 🎯 Enhanced Board Column Setup Guide

## Current Issue
GitHub Projects v2 column management requires manual setup through the web interface. The GitHub CLI doesn't yet support adding custom status options programmatically.

## ✅ Manual Setup Process

### Step 1: Access Your Project Board
Go to: https://github.com/users/yannicklaclau/projects/2

### Step 2: Customize Status Field
1. **Click the dropdown arrow** next to "Status" in the column headers
2. **Select "Settings"** from the dropdown menu
3. **Add new status options** by clicking "+ Add option"

### Step 3: Add These Enhanced Columns
Replace the default options with our enhanced workflow:

#### **Current Default Options (Delete These):**
- ❌ Todo → Delete
- ❌ In Progress → Keep (rename to 🚧 In Progress)  
- ❌ Done → Delete

#### **Add These New Options (in priority order):**
1. **👀 Needs Review** 
   - Color: Red (#e74c3c)
   - Description: Items requiring personal attention/decision-making
   - Position: Far left for maximum visibility

2. **💡 Ideas** 
   - Color: Purple (#9b59b6)
   - Description: Creative brainstorming and concepts

3. **📋 Backlog**
   - Color: Gray (#95a5a6)  
   - Description: Well-defined items ready to work on

4. **🚧 In Progress** (rename existing)
   - Color: Orange (#f39c12)
   - Description: Currently being worked on

5. **✅ Done This Week**
   - Color: Green (#27ae60)
   - Description: Completed this week

6. **📦 Archive**
   - Color: Dark Gray (#34495e)
   - Description: Items >6 weeks old

### Step 4: Reorganize Existing Issues
After adding the columns, drag issues to appropriate places:

#### **💡 Ideas:**
- Issue #5: "Personalized city themes based on visited places"

#### **📋 Backlog:**
- Issue #3: "Research best practices for typing pedagogy"
- Issue #4: "Improve city building visual design"
- Issue #1: "Add sound effects for typing and explosions"
- Issue #6: "User Feedback - Need testing with actual 8-year-old"

#### **🚧 In Progress:**
- Issue #2: "Words sometimes don't register keystrokes correctly" (critical bug)

### Step 5: Set Up Filtering and Views
1. **Create filtered views** for different work types:
   - Click "+ New view" 
   - Add filters like: "Priority: High" or "Type: Bug"

2. **Common useful views:**
   - **Active Work**: Filter by "📋 Backlog" + "🚧 In Progress"
   - **Bugs Only**: Filter by "🐛 bug" label
   - **Ideas**: Filter by "💡 Ideas" status

## 🤖 Future Automation Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Coming Soon)
Once columns are set up manually, we can automate movement:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/board-automation.yml
name: Board Automation
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]

jobs:
  organize_board:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Move ideas to Ideas column
        if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, '💡 idea')
        # API call to move issue to Ideas column
        
      - name: Move critical bugs to In Progress
        if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, '🔥 priority-critical')
        # API call to move to In Progress for immediate attention
```

### Option 2: Third-Party Tools
- **Zapier/IFTTT**: Automate based on GitHub webhooks
- **GitHub Copilot Workspace**: Enhanced project management features

## 📊 Weekly Management Process

### Every Monday:
1. **Create new "Done Week X" column** (manual for now)
2. **Move completed items** from "Done This Week" to dated column
3. **Archive columns** older than 6 weeks
4. **Review and prioritize** backlog items

### Sample Weekly Columns:
- ✅ Done Week 30 (Jul 22-28)
- ✅ Done Week 31 (Jul 29-Aug 4)  
- ✅ Done Week 32 (Aug 5-11)
- ✅ Done This Week (current)

## 🎯 Expected Result

After setup, your board will have a priority-driven professional workflow:

```
👀 Needs Review → 💡 Ideas → 📋 Backlog → 🚧 In Progress → ✅ Done This Week → 📦 Archive
```

## 🎯 **Key Workflow Concepts:**

### **👀 Needs Review - Priority Inbox**
The far-left position creates a **priority queue** for items requiring personal attention:

**Use Cases:**
- **Ideas → Backlog**: Evaluate if creative ideas are worth developing
- **Completed Work**: Validate that "done" work meets quality standards
- **Personal Tasks**: Items only you can handle (user research, stakeholder communication)
- **Blocked Items**: Work waiting on your decision or input
- **Quality Gates**: Anything requiring judgment before proceeding

**Workflow Principle**: Address "Needs Review" items **first** before other work - they're often blockers for team productivity.

### **Typical Item Journey:**
1. **New Idea** → 💡 Ideas
2. **Idea Evaluation** → 👀 Needs Review → 📋 Backlog (if approved)
3. **Development** → 🚧 In Progress  
4. **Quality Check** → 👀 Needs Review → ✅ Done This Week (if approved)
5. **Archive** → 📦 Archive (after 6+ weeks)

This creates a clear pipeline with appropriate **human judgment points** throughout the development process.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Manual Setup Required**: GitHub CLI doesn't support column customization yet
2. **One-Time Process**: Once set up, the columns persist and can be automated
3. **Team Training**: Make sure all contributors understand the column meanings
4. **Regular Maintenance**: Weekly column management keeps the board organized

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands (After Manual Setup)

```bash
# Create new idea and add to board
gh issue create --title "Idea - [concept]" --body "Details..." --label "📋 priority-low"
gh project item-add 2 --owner yannicklaclau --url [issue-url]

# Move items between columns (once API supports it)
gh project item-edit [PROJECT_ID] [ITEM_ID] --field-id [STATUS_FIELD_ID] --single-select-option-id [COLUMN_ID]

# Weekly review of completed work
gh issue list --label "✅ done-this-week" --state closed
```

This enhanced board structure will transform your project management from basic task tracking to comprehensive product development workflow! 🎯
