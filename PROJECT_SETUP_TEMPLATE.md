  | jq 'map((.closedAt | fromdateiso8601) - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601)) | add / length'
```

### Board Health Check
```bash
# Items in each column
gh project item-list PROJECT_NUMBER --owner YOUR_USERNAME --format json \
  | jq 'group_by(.status) | map({status: .[0].status, count: length})'

# Identify stale items
