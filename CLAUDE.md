# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a typing tutor application project. The codebase is currently in initial setup phase.

## Development Setup

This project appears to be in early development. Common setup commands will be added here as the project structure develops.

## Project Structure

The project structure will be documented here as components are added:

- Main application files will be organized based on the chosen framework/technology stack
- Configuration files for build tools, testing, and linting will be added
- Assets and resources for the typing tutor functionality

## Key Commands

Commands for development workflow will be documented here once the project structure is established:

```bash
# Development server
# To be added based on chosen framework

# Build process  
# To be added based on build tooling

# Testing
# To be added based on testing framework

# Linting/Formatting
# To be added based on code quality tools
```

## Architecture Notes

The typing tutor application architecture will be documented here as it develops, including:

- How typing exercises are structured and managed
- User progress tracking implementation
- Real-time typing feedback mechanisms
- Performance metrics and analytics
- UI/UX patterns for typing practice interfaces

## Development Guidelines

- Focus on responsive design for various screen sizes and devices
- Implement accessible keyboard navigation patterns
- Consider performance optimizations for real-time typing feedback
- Design modular components for different typing exercise types
